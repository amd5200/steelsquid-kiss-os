This is a minimal and optimized version of Raspbian (http://www.raspbian.org/).
Think this is a perfect version to start building something from ... you decide what you want to install.
I have used raspbian-ua-netinst as the basis for this distribution, also changed from Debian stable into testing.

You can easily configure WIFI and other stuff from command line and a web interface.
It contains no desktop environment.

There are probably some bugs, please help me to find them.
